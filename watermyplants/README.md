# Water My Plant

## Introduction

>Our React App `water-my-plants` solves the issue of young millennials forgetting to water their plants. So we have created an app that allows you to schedule when to water your plants and send you text reminders when those plants are ready to be watered.

     We completed the components together. Towards the end we paired programmed together on everything but for the components themselves Brianna took most of the login/sigup and Kate took a lot of the plant components. We controlled local state where it was needed. Unfortunately we didn't get the opportunity to use a 3rd party API but we would like to implement something with this API or something similar for a search function to find your species of plant. `https://codesandbox.io/s/unit-2-build-week-axios-call-wmp-ymr9s`.
